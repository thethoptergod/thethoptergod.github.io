        <span id=title1 class=title>The Origins of Progressive Rock in England</span>
        <br>
        Progressive rock had its beginnings in the UK, starting with bands such as Procol Harum, the Nice, and Van der Graff Generator. These proto-prog bands tended to have softer, and less intense sounds, and the songs were far longer than their contemporaries, ranging 
        from 5 to 17 minutes. Many of the people involved in these early bands moved onto other bands in the later years as prog rock matured, such as Keith Emerson leaving the Nice and Greg Lake leaving King Crimson and forming ELP with Carl Palmer. Some of the best examples 
        of this early period are 1969's 21st Century Schizoid Man by King Crimson, featuring Robert Fripp's excellent fuzzed guitar riffs and a horn section, Procol Harum's A Whiter Shade Of Pale, an amazing organ ballad from 1967 with a long connected composition. One of the first "long" prog 
        rock songs is Iron Butterfly's 1968 monster of a piece In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, which at just over 17 minutes is an amazing collection of guitar, drum solos, and psychedelic riffs.

        <span id=title2 class=title>Progressive Rock Comes Into its Own</span>
        <br>
        Starting in the early seventies, prog rock started to bloom into a genre of its own, with bands such as Yes, Jethro Tull, Emerson Lake and Palmer, and King Crimsons more evolved sounds. Yes, with the incredible guitar of Steve Howe, the masterful drumming of Bill Bruford, the 
        soaring vocals of Jon Anderson, the keyboard wizardry of Rick Wakeman, and the genius bass playing of Chris Squire created some of the greatest and most popular prog rock of all time, and their influence spanned throughout the world, from their contemporaries in England to 
        the freezing wastes of Canada. Jethro Tull, who began as a much more folk based band, released one of the greatest prog rock songs ever, Thick as a Brick. The song clocks in at just under 44 minutes long, and is full of the great guitar work of Martin Barre and the amazing 
        vocals and flute of Jon Anderson. The far more keyboard focused sound of ELP gave them a distinctly different sound to those around them, lending itself to far more chaotic compositions.

        <span id=title3 class=title>Progressive Rock Branches Out</span>
        <br>
        The early 70s, France. Christian Vander and Magma create one of the most insane and other-worldly albums to ever be recorded. The album is titled Koba&#239;a, named after the planet it takes place on. The album is the story of people fleeing from earth to this new planet, 
        sung as a legend told by their descendants, entirely in a language that Vander invented. In Italy, around the same time, bands like Goblin are creating horror themed prog rock. Some while later, a band called Dexy's Midnight Runners records their third album. It is a tonal shift worthy of 
        whiplash after their last big hit, Come On Eileen. The album, titled Don't Stand Me Down, released in 1985, is a testament to the genius of Kevin Rowland. The album featured strange things such as conversations within the songs, and was a commercial failure, leading to 
        the breakup of what was left of the band. Nowadays, the album is considered a lost masterpiece by many, and I am inclined to agree.

        <span id=title4 class=title>Progressive Rocks Rise to Popularity</span>
        <br>
        In the mid-seventies, prog rock started to become popular thanks to bands such as Pink Floyd, Genesis, and The Who. The Who, while not strictly a prog rock band, released some of the most influential concept albums of all time, Tommy and Quadrophenia. 
        These albums, powered by the incredible work of Roger Daltry on vocals, the great Pete Townshend on guitar, the monstrous bottom end provided by John Entwhistle on bass, and the erratic and unique drumming of Keith Moon, were, and still are, inspirations worldwide. 
        Genesis, powered by the incredible singing and flute of Peter Gabriel and the masterful drumming of Phil Collins created some of the most popular prog rock ever with songs like Firth of Fifth and the master concept album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. 
        Pink Floyd, one of the most popular bands of all time, with the bass and vocals of Roger Waters, the guitar of David Gilmour, the drumming of Nick Mason, and the keys of Richard Wright resulted in some of the most famous albums of all time, not just famous 
        in the prog rock community.

        The influence of the bands above reaches around the world, and all throughout time. Those Who Ride With Giants, an artist from Australia, creates instrumental concept albums about a world with gigantic beasts who roam around the land. David Bowie's Station To Station is 
        a distinctly progressive sounding record, off the heels of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars. The Claypool Lennon Delirium, a super group made up of Primus member Les Claypool and Sean Lennon of Ghost of a Sabertooth Tiger add their unique spins on prog rock.
